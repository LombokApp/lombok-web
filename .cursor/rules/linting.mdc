When linting, use the package specific lint check and fix commands like `bun --cwd ./packages/api lint:check` and `bun --cwd ./packages/api lint:fix`. There's also `bun --cwd ./packages/api prettier:check` and `bun --cwd ./packages/api prettier:fix`. Only fix linting errors that are created by your own changes. Don't remove debug logging unless you are the one that added it.
